# Statistics Learning and Optimization

## Overview

This repository provides implementations and analyses around machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as advanced statistical models such as recursive logistic regression, and optimization algorithms.

## Sub-projects

### 1. Machine Learning / SVM

This part of the repository contains the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

- **Files included**:
  - Implementation of SVM for classification.
  - Model evaluation and testing.

### 2. Advanced Optimization

This section deals with advanced optimization algorithms. The focus is on techniques used to solve complex optimization problems that arise in various fields such as operations research and machine learning.

- **Files included**:
  - Optimization algorithms and their applications.
  - Code for solving optimization problems.

### 3. Statistics / Recursive Logistic Regression

This part includes an advanced statistical model known as recursive logistic regression. This model is useful for understanding relationships in data and is widely applied in fields like economics and bioinformatics.

- **Files included**:
  - Recursive logistic regression implementation.
  - Statistical analysis and model evaluation.

### 4. TSP Problem (Travelling Salesman Problem)

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the origin city.

- **Files included**:
  - Implementation for solving the TSP problem.
  - Algorithms and techniques used for TSP.
